Originally written for TU/e students. 

## Intro

Ok, first of all, apologies for the abstractness of the explanation. It‚Äôs a relatively complicated program, and it's best to know how it actually works, not just the magic commands that fix everything, because they don‚Äôt always work. And besides, the original target audience of this summary were computer science students with a 9 or higher for 2IP90, they should be able to do this.  
I also recommend _(and assume you use something like)_ [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as a GUI to git, which normally only has a CLI. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) also works. There is a list of other GUI's [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/). A lot of editors like IDEA and Visual Studio Code, also have plugins or built-in support for git, however not always very extensive. 

I don't go that much in depth in the actual commands since I am assuming you use SourceTree, and it's possible to look it up. Also, this is the first time I actually try to explain git to someone else, and I have no idea how much experience you guys have. If this goes too quickly, there is a way longer tutorial listed below. I think I already spent too much time on this. But please ~~leave a like and subscribe~~ let me know how it goes.

_XKCD: If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything._

## Summary

Ok, git is a distributed version control system. This means it‚Äôs an app that keeps records of versions of your data (in most cases: source code). Distributed means, among some other things, that it works offline and the git database is also hosted locally.

There are hosting providers of git servers, most well known are GitHub, GitLab üá≥üá±, and BitBucket.

### Branches, commits and clones

A git repo(sitory) consists of branches, the default being called ```master```. (insert bad BDSM joke here)  
Branches consist of a pointer to the last `commit`.  
Commits are small versions or snapshots of your version of the source code, consisting of a snapshot of the version of the code, a pointer to the previous commit (a ```NIL``` pointer if it is the first one) and if it is a merge commit, (a commit that merges two branches), a second (and sometimes even a third in a üêômerge) pointer to the commit it merges. Commits also contain metadata about the date they were created and the author. (For those who follow or have followed 2IL50, the commit history is btw a DAG.)

Commits are immutable, and the pointer is a cryptographic hash.  
Selecting files to commit is called staging.

#### Checking out a branch (`git checkout`)

If you clone a repo, the `master` branch is checked-out by default. This means that the version that's currently in the directory is the commit your `master` branch points to. You can use SourceTree or the `git branch` command to create or switch to a different one. There is a special branch, called `HEAD` that points to the currently checked-out version of the code. (Most of the time, SourceTree doesn't display the head branch, but just displays the current branch in **bold**).

Git works mostly offline. If you clone (aka download) a git repo, you also download the entire commit history. If you then add a commit, the branches on your computer are updated, but the branches on the server are not.  

### `Push` and `Pull`

For that, there are two operations, Push: sending your commits to the server; and Pull: downloading the new commits from the server. (Insert another bad sex joke here) 
`Push` fails if the commits on the server contain newer ones, `pull` doesn't unless there are merge-conflicts, which SourceTree will ask you to solve. Therefore, pull before you push. 
We could just all use the master branch, but it‚Äôs also possible to use a new temporally branch, then asking someone else to review the code, (AKA sending a pull request or merge request) and then asking the reviewer to merge that code. (AKA merging a pull request) There are git repos where only the _‚Äòdictator‚Äô_ (aka scrum master) has push permission on the master branch on the main repo and repos where everyone has. I don‚Äôt know which permission model is the best for this project, my suggestion is though to put some safeguards in place so someone doesn‚Äôt mess up the entire repo.  

There are some advanced options for the `pull` command, that make for a cleaner commit history, ~~but they are complicated and outside the scope of this short tutorial.~~ in the chapter below.

### `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`, `git reflog` and `git reset`

If you made mistake, for example, you committed all your passwords, and you want them removed from Git history, it's possible to use these commands to change/rewrite history. However, they are very dangerous, and it takes a long time to explain them. Because I don't know how well the rest of the tutorial will go, I haven't (yet) explained them (all) here in detail. In the meanwhile, please use the [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if you want to know more about them.

`git commit --amend` is a commit that creates a new commit, but makes the parent be the parent of the current commit, and deletes the current commit if that was the only reference.  

`git reset` resets the commit-pointer of the branch to a given commit.

`git rebase` travels through time and changes history. It's way too complicated to explain here.

`git reflog` lists recent commits. Very handy if you want to undo any of the above commands.

### forks

There are also things called forks, which is a fancy name for a copy of a git repo in your own namespace from which you can send merge requests.

Most of the time, both the fork and the original repo should be added as a remote.

**Important note**: If you fork a private project in GitLab, please add the main project group as a reporter in _Project Settings_ (left down) ‚Üí _Members_.

### `git fetch`

Last, but not least: `git fetch`. Git has a possibility to bookmark repo-URLs. Bookmarks are called `remote`s. For those repos the branches are mirrored to the local git repo on the PC; ```origin/master``` for example is the Git branch on the main repo if you called that main repo ```origin```. ```Git fetch``` refreshes those repos.

## Practical things

Start by cloning the repo. I recommend to use the https URL listed at the repo page on Windows, it really doesn‚Äôt like SSH keys. (And SSH-keys are complicated to set up). Also, use SourceTree to do so.
It‚Äôs possible to use GitKraken.  

### GitLab specific stuff

* Has, like almost all git hosters, built-in pull requests.  
* Has an autobuild (CI/CD) function that runs tests and publishes it as a website that we could potentially use. (It‚Äôs basically Momotor+website hosting, only you can write the tests now, and not the TU/e staff, and you don‚Äôt get a bad grade if your tests fail.)  
* The master branch is restricted by default. It e.g. doesn‚Äôt allow you to use a force push. (A push that rewrites history.)  
* If you sent a pull request from a fork, please add the group as a reporter by the group members. GitLab doesn't do that automatically for some reason.
* Use your username and password of GitLab when asked in SourceTree. I think there is a password reminder function somewhere but forgot where. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* * The command `git config credential.helper` should return `manager`. 
* * If that doesn't work, I think it was the [Microsoft Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows). Not sure though.

### Project structure

* If you want a better, but longer, tutorial, that isn't written by me: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>.  Also available in [Dutch](https://git-scm.com/book/nl/v2) and mostly available in [Polish](https://git-scm.com/book/pl/v2).
* You can also look up the syntax of the CLI: <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit>.  
* * Again, SourceTree is often easier.
